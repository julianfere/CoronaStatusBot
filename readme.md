# CoronaStatusBot
---
CoronaStatus is a simple discord bot that keeps track of the covid-19 situation

It's made for work with a MongoDB cluster so... yeah it can work in different servers :D

## How it works:

1. First you invite the bot on your server
2. Then you configure the channel and the country with the following command
   
   ``` !c #Channel 'country' ```

3. Use ```!u``` to show the first message

**Note:** For the moment if you want to update the Embed you have to use ```!u``` again
or add a react

## Future features

- Manage multiple Embeds
