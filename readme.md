# CoronaStatusBot
---
CoronaStatus is a simple discord bot that keeps track of the covid-19 situation

It's made for work with a MongoDB cluster so... yeah it can work in different servers :D

## How it works:

1. First you invite the bot on your server
2. Then you configure the channel and the country with the following command
   
   ``` !c #Channel 'country' ```

3. Use ```!a Country``` to start tracking
